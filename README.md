ArrayList
=========

An Simple ArrayList in Objective-C
This is the third time that I'm tring to using Generic in Objective-C, and I think this time is almost prefect.
The idea was beginning when I saw [tomersh/Objective-C-Generics](https://github.com/tomersh/Objective-C-Generics), I think that was a brillant idea with a little bit flaws. 
And now I fix those flaws and make a simple way to using Generic in Objective-C
